</p>
A group of students from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Salerno aims to create a project for a new web application, a social network called AstroVerse. The main purpose of the system is to connect groups of people through virtual groups (spaces), both private and public, where users can share posts and ideas on a topic chosen by the channel creator. Unlike other common social networks where topics are often generic and treated superficially, with users frequently sharing low-quality posts, AstroVerse encourages content creation by rewarding originality, quality, and creativity. Furthermore, the system, through the use of spaces dedicated to specific and focused topics, helps to avoid ambiguity in the information being shared.
